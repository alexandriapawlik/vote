To do:

create contract to tally votes and announce winner
create simple interface
test/compile example voting contract from solidity by example
create test contracts

fix:
only allow 1 token per proposal
    currently voters can only perticipate in one vote at a time
identity checking (linking identity to address)
eliminate ability to transfer token
add events
control permissions for adding votes
    currently createToken and createElection are onlyOwner
